As described previously, PurGPT functions through requests to URLs. The way a URL is constructed is through the following format: https://purgpt.xyz/ `company` [/](https://purgpt.xyz) `product`.

Below is the full list of endpoints we offer, as well as their descriptions & URLs.

***Note**: When a word is surrounded by "< " and ">", it should be substituted by a different value. (`<company>`, for example, could be `openai`)*
