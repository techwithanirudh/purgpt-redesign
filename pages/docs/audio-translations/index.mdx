Audio Translations is a feature that allows you to convert spoken language in different languages into written text in one specific language.

It's useful for:

- Transcribing many user-uploaded audio in diverse languages to one text file in one language

- Transcribing audio files for journalists, students, researchers, and professionals who need to convert interviews, lectures, or meetings in different languages into written format.

- Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. They can use audio translations to understand and respond to user commands in different languages.

- Language learning apps, making them able to use audio translations to provide learners with instant translations of their spoken language exercises.

- Automatically generating subtitles for movies, TV shows, and online videos in different languages.

And much more!
