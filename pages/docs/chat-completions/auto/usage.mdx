# Using Automatic Chat Completion

This endpoint doesn't require any fields outside of `messages`. Our API will automatically set the best settings based on latest prompt in your `messages` (of course, using AI). It supports all available chat completion models and personalities. Also, you can overwrite anything by just adding the field to your request body.
