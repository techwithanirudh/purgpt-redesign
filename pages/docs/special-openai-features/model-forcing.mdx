# Model Forcing

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This only works for OpenAI endpoints!
</Callout>

There is an optional query parameter for OpenAI endpoints: `forceModel`

This parameter can only be `true{:json}`, `auto` or `false{:json}`. Defaults to `auto`.

- If it is `true{:json}`, the API will try to find responses with your requested model.
- If it is `auto`, the API will try to find responses with your requested model. If not found, will return first valid response.
- If it is `false{:json}`, the API will return first valid response.

    state "Return response" as trueFound
    state "Return error" as trueNotFound

    trueCheck --> trueFound : Model found
    trueCheck --> trueNotFound : Model not found
  }

  forceModel --> auto
  state auto {
    state "Check providers" as autoCheck
    state "Return response" as autoFound
    state "All providers errored?" as autoNotFound
    state "Return error" as autoError
    state "Return first valid response" as autoNotError

    autoCheck --> autoFound : Model found
    autoCheck --> autoNotFound : Model not found
    autoNotFound --> autoError : Yes
    autoNotFound --> autoNotError : No
  }

  forceModel --> false
  state false {
    state "Check providers" as falseCheck
    state "Return response" as falseFound
    state "Return error" as falseNotFound

    falseCheck --> falseFound : Valid response found
    falseCheck --> falseNotFound : All providers errored
  }
```
