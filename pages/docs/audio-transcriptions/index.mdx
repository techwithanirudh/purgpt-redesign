# What are Audio Transcriptions?

Audio transcription is the act of converting spoken words from an audio recording into written text. 

It's useful for:

- Transcribing meetings or conversations into written form.

- Making content accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, ensuring they can understand spoken information.

- Creating written versions of podcasts, videos, and interviews; making it easier to repurpose and share content.

- Improving search engine optimization (SEO) by providing text that search engines can index, making your content more discoverable online.

- Transcribed audio can be translated into different languages, reaching a broader audience.

- Researchers who need to analyze and study spoken data, like interviews and focus groups.

- Transcribing research interviews or user feedback, to help in categorizing and analyzing data for insights.
