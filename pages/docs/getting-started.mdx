# Getting Started

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, to use this API and obtain a key, you **must** have a Discord
  account.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Gaining the power: obtaining a key
 
Think you're worthy to start with PurGPT? We sure do! If you agree with us, simply follow the steps below!

1. Head over to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9PU85As8Pd) and verify with Waya (will require not being a robot)

2. Once there, click into the <DiscordChannel>👾 | commands</DiscordChannel> channel

3. Run the `/key` command

4. The PurGPT bot will respond with your key. **Do not, under any circumstance, share it with anyone! It's yours :)**

Here's a visual:

### Unleashing the power: using the AI

Once you have your key, the power of PurGPT can be unleashed. Before moving to this step, if you wish, you may test out PurGPT by chatting with it: Use the `/chat` command!

The way that one interacts with PurGPT is, currently, through POST requests (whether that be through cURL, `fetch()`, or other means). This makes it easy to use and cross platform.

A simple demonstration of using PurGPT is below:

<Tabs items={["JS fetch()", "JS xhr", "PY", "Rust", "Java", "cURL"]}>
  <Tab>**pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager.</Tab>
  <Tab>
    **npm** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>**Yarn** is a software packaging system.</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>
