  **PurGPT is a free way to interact with all of OpenAI's technology.**

  It provides free access to all the completion models (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, etc), audio transcription models (`whisper-1`), embedding models (`text-embedding-ada-002`, etc), image generation models and so much more. 
  
  We also provide access to BingAI and You.com's AI!
